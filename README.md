### Wrong Skins
- Hallowed is categorized as a VITA, even tho it should be a SCAR (referencing boden's behance - https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/disp/85b57f164120025.67d2f92b2f6b3.png )
- Panda Pug is a VITA but somehow it has a scuffed texture from Comic VITA. Panda Pug has in the Assets Server a different texture - https://discord.com/channels/938067541698416670/938636280802193458/1331224855357427753
